##Manifest 

* `2ITO` - looks good 
* `2ITY` - has a structural ion bound 
* `2ITZ` - has a structural ion bound 
* `3UG2` - has a loop in an interesting conformation after modeling, molecule of Eomes bound that might need to be removed 
* `4I22` - has two sulfate ions bound, has a loop that is disordered in other structures resolved as an alpha helix. Distinctly different conformation 
* `4WKQ` - has a sodium ion bound, loop failed to be modeled in because it was too long, eomes also bound

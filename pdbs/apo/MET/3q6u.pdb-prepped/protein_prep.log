Done treating metals
Assigning bond orders...
  Using CCD: True
CCD template assignment failed for HET "AME " due to:
  Atom count mismatch between the HET and the CCD record.
  Falling back to bond order assignment based on geometry.
  Assigned the following bonds (format: atom1, atom2, order): set([(8, 9, 2), (2, 3, 2)])
